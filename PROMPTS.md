# Step 1: Generate the project

I did not do multiple attempts here.

Even though Cascade was in Write mode, it just gave me instructions to create
the project, including generated code, but expected me to do it manually. The
code in this repo is that generated code, manually added as instructed by
Claude.

# Step 2: Code cleanup

You might have an expectation of the results now that you've seen attempts 1 and
2, and... yeah. Same deal. Cascade, even in Write mode, doesn't think to check
the project files. It does the same, even though I explicitly have been trying
to tell it that I have already done everything it asked previously. It continues
to act like it set down a "game plan" at first and is now executing it,
seemingly no matter how many ways I try to tell it I did everything already.
