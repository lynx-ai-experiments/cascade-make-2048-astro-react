# Step 1: Generate the project

I did not do multiple attempts here.

> make a playable 2048 game with smooth animations via Framer Motion and React,
> in an Astro app, using Tailwind CSS"

Even though Cascade was in Write mode, it just gave me instructions to create
the project, including generated code, but expected me to do it manually. The
code in this repo is that generated code, manually added as instructed by
Claude.

# Step 2: Code cleanup

## Attempt 1

> Clean up the code and remove any code or assets we're not using.

❌ **Failed.** Cascade did not sense that the code already existed, so it
overwrote several things and, instead of leaving the code cleaner, added a bunch
of random hanging files.
